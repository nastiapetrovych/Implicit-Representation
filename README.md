This project focuses on transforming 3D objects from the traditional .obj mesh format to Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), a more efficient and accurate method for representing 3D geometry. SDFs encode spatial information as distance values, offering advantages over meshes, especially in scalability and flexibility. The task involves not only format conversion but also training individual neural networks for each SDF-converted object. This specialized approach ensures tailored learning and precision for each object's unique characteristics. Our methodology, deviating from standard practices, leverages direct transformations of feature vectors from grids, omitting neural networks, to achieve more effective SDF-based 3D representation.
